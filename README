Django Multiuploader Plugin
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Readme for plugin of Django Multiuploader using jQuery Plugin by Sebastian Tschan(https://blueimp.net/).

This is a plugin, made using multiupload form from Sebastian Tschan.
It uses jQuey UI and jQuery instead of Flash uploader.
On Django side it uses sorl-thumbnails and PIL.
You can use it in your applications with simple inclusion tag

Requirements:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    - PIL(Python Imaging Library) (for sorl)
    - sorl-thumbnail's(http://thumbnail.sorl.net/) (for thumbnails generation)


Example usage:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding this AJAX form to your web site is as simple, as adding this 2 tags to your template:

    {% load multiuploader %}
    {% multiupform %}

Installation:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Install an app. Do it by adding:

    'multiuploader', 

string to your settings.py -> INSTALLED_APPS = () dictionary.
Note that is has to have 'sorl.thumbnail', working already.

2.Register urls in your root urlconf urls.py adding string to your urlpatterns like so :

    url(r'', include('multiuploader.urls')),

3.Copy or symlink files from plugins "media/" directory to your MEDIA_ROOT.

4.Edit templates and styles to meet your needs. (Optional)
    (for e.g. changing the form design and/or behavior)


Settings:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can override plugin behavior by adding those settings to your root settings.py:

*File delete url to use in your app. default value is '/multi_delete/'

     MULTI_FILE_DELETE_URL = '/multi_delete/'

*Url to show uploaded image, default is '/multi_image/' + key to identify image (about 80 characters long):

     MULTI_IMAGE_URL = '/multi_image/'

*Folder to store uploaded pictures inside your MEDIA_ROOT folder

     MULTI_IMAGES_FOLDER = 'multiuploader_images/'


Model Usage:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Plugin stores Uploaded images to a simple model. It has some those fields:

* "MultiuploaderImage.filename" CharField to store original (uploaded) file filename
* "MultiuploaderImage.file" FileField to store file link to uploaded file in file system
* "MultiuploaderImage.key_data" CharField with randomly generated key to use in your model
* "MultiuploaderImage.upload_date" DateTimeField to store file upload data with auto now adding

You can use it directly in your code like so:

    #views.py
    def multi_show_uploaded(request, key):
        image = get_object_or_404(MultiuploaderImage, key_data=key)
        url = settings.MEDIA_URL+image.image.name
        return render_to_response('multiuploader/one_image.html', {"multi_single_url":url,})
        
And then in template:

    #'multiuploader/one_image.html'
    <img src="{{ multi_single_url }}">

I will not stop on model usage here for long. Fell free to ask me any questions appeared...

Development plans:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Add a way to specify which model to use to store files.
